# timesheeet.sh

work in progress.


timesheeet.sh is a shell script that lets you create a timetable of your monthly work hours for controllers and supervisors. Simply add your day's work time, monthly days worked, project names and the percentage you feel, and vacation days, and voila, timesheeet.sh will create a professionally formatted document that looks convincing to controlling and auditors alike.
